# Assign swap memory:

Insert a USB drive, and find the drive path for the device:

sudo blkid

# Unmount the drive:

sudo umount /dev/XXX

#Format swap device:

sudo mkswap /dev/XXX

# If the previous command outputted an alphanumeric UUID, copy that now. Otherwise, find the UUID by running blkid again. Copy the UUID associated with /dev/XXX:

sudo blkid

# Edit your /etc/fstab file to register your swap file:

sudo nano /etc/fstab

# On a separate line, enter the following information. Replace the X's with the UUID (without quotes)

UUID=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX none swap sw,pri=5 0 0

# Save /etc/fstab, by typing ctrl+x, then type y, press return, to exit your text editor

# Run the following command:

sudo swapon -a

If you get an error claiming it can't find your UUID, go back and edit /etc/fstab. Replace the UUID=XXX.. bit with the original /dev/XXX information.

sudo nano /etc/fstab

# Replace the UUID with /dev/XXX

/dev/XXX none swap sw,pri=5 0 0

Save the swap device ID /dev/XXX information to remove the device safely after the tensorflow installation
