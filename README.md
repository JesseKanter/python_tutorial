# Learn Python 3 for machine learning.

**A repository of codes and tutorials for running NLP machine and deep learning methods using Keras and Tensorflow.**

**For the "Hello World! Python Workshops @ Think Coffee", intermediate complexity lessons organized by the AI @ Columbia University Medical Center NYC MeetUp co-organizer Rahul Remanan.**

Instructions for running 05_Bidirectional_LSTM_classifier.py:

	install spacy english language model:
	sudo python -m spacy download en
	
	create a folder to save the trained model:
	mkdir model

	cmd:
	python 05_Bidirectional_LSTM_classifier.py model train test
