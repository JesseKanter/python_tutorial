# Learn Python 3 for deep learning.

**A repository of codes and tutorials for running natural language processing (NLP) and machine vision using deep learning methods with Keras, Tensorflow and OpenCV.**

**For the "Hello World! Python Workshops @ Think Coffee", intermediate complexity lessons organized by the [AI @ Columbia University Medical Center NYC MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/AI-at-CUMC/) in collaboration with [Moad Computer](https://www.moad.computer) - manufacturer of open-source dev-ops server for deep learning with co-host Rahul Remanan.**

**Below, we are detailing the scripts in this repo.**
